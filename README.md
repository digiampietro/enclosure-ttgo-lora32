# Enclosure for the "LILYGO/TTGO Lora32 V2.1_1.6" board

This
[ESP32 based board with LoRa chip](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/lora3)
is used in many projects including:

- [TinyGS](https://tinygs.com/)

- [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)

- [MySondy GO](https://mysondy.altervista.org/mysondygo.php)

and many more.

The [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) source uses the fantastic
library
[YAPP_Box Yet Another Parametric Projectbox generator](https://github.com/mrWheel/YAPP_Box)
to generate the enclosure for this little board with room for the optional rechargable battery.

The main features of this enclosure are:

- Tightly assembled with:

  - USB, SD and antenna connectors easily accessible.

  - The LEDs are easily visible through small holes in the enclosure.

  - The power switch in the bottom is easily accessible with a finger.

  - The display is cleary visible.

  - There are dedicated holes to attach a string.

- No screws needed, thanks to *snap joints* base and lid "click"
  together without the need for screws or other aids.

- The circuit board is neatly clamped between the base standoffs and
  the lid push-downs and is correctly aligned thanks to the antenna
  connector holder.

- A dedicated space for the optional rechargable battery with the size
  of 4cm x 3 cm x 0.9 cm.

In the [3dmodel](3dmodel/) folder you will find:

- The 3D STL model.

- The `.3mf` file is created by *Bambu Lab Studio*, it contains the
  3D model and the *print profile* with printing parameters I used on
  my *Bambu Lab A1* printer.

In the [img](img/) folder you will find more enclosure images.

# Notes

- To close or open the enclosure, gently press the base with your
  fingers near the snap joints (in the center) to facilitate the
  process or use a small flathead screwdriver to free the lid from the
  joints. Be careful not to bend the lid during removal or insertion
  to avoid breaking the standoffs.
